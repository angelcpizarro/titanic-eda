# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualisation, it investigates how demographics and passenger characteristics affected the likelihood of survival.

This is one of my early Python-based data analysis projects and showcases foundational skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data storytelling.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and understand the structure of the Titanic dataset
- Handle missing values and clean the data
- Explore feature relationships and their impact on survival
- Visualise insights to uncover patterns and trends

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Gender** was the most significant predictor of survival:  
  - ~74% of women survived vs. ~19% of men.
  
- **Passenger Class** had a strong influence:  
  - Survival rates were highest among first-class passengers.
  
- **Children** (under age 10) also had higher survival rates.
  
- **Fare and age** showed correlations with survival but less strongly than gender/class.
